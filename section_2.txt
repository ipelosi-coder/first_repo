The computational approach the authors are proposing to use is an approach capable of predicting protein structures near experimental accuracy. In the past, computational methods to predict three dimensional protein structures fell short due to the computational intractability of molecular simulation, thus protein structures yielded different results experimentally versus theoretically. The authors propose the algorithm AlphaFold, which improves the accuracy of structure predictions of protein structures. Instead of theorizing protein structures based solely on their amino acid chain sequence, AlphaFold incorporates novel neural network architectures and training procedures based on the evolutionary, physical and geometric contributions to protein structure. Alphafold is a deep learning model architecture, which includes supervised and unsupervised learning — where users can train neural networks with protein data and reward the program based on success and incorporating new data to better improve the AlphaFold architecture. This new architecture jointly embeds multiple sequence alignments and pairwise features, the program self estimates and self corrects the accuracy of the protein structures. AlphaFold specifically predicts the 3D coordinates of all the heavy atoms within the amino acid sequence of the protein and using the molecular stimulation it can predict how all these features would interact to form the 3D structure. Overall, Alphafold predicts 3D protein structures through deep learning neural networks that enable accurate prediction of these protein structures.
